## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This project is built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The Javascript date library moment was also used to format timestamps.

## Installation

To install and use this app, clone this repo and navigate to the root directory. Run `npm i` to install the necessary libraries used to run this app e.g. express, etc. These libraries are specified in the package.json.

## Usage

To run this app locally on your machine, navigate to the project root. Run the command `npm run start` to run the app. If you are actively developing, you can alternatively run `npm run watch` so that every time you save the file you don't need to restart the server (thanks to nodemon).

The testing was done via a tool called Insomnia; see below screenshot of what it looks like to test the APIs.
